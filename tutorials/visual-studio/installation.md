In Visual Studio 2019, it is very easy to choose and install only those features you need and that's why it installs quickly and with less system impact.

You can select one of the following editions.

 - Visual Studio 2019 Community (Free download)

So click on the **Free download** button, and once the *.exe file is downloaded, right-click and select the Run as administrator on the downloaded file to begin the installation.
