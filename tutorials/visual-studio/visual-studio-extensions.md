# Visual Studio Extensions

Microsoft Visual Studio is one of the top IDEs for the development of modern applications. 

 - It is a very robust application for developers and it has tons of features that help to ease the development process. 
 - These features can be further customized or new features can be added using Visual Studio Extensions. 
 
## What are extensions?

Extensions are add-ons that allow you to customize and enhance your experience in Visual Studio by adding new features or integrating existing tools. 

 - An extension can range in all levels of complexity, but its main purpose is to increase your productivity.
 - You can personalize the IDE based on your workflow and style, add support for external tools not yet integrated with Visual Studio, and modify existing functionality to increase your productivity.

You can browse thousands of extensions available in the Marketplace to find the tools you need. The extensions are available at Visual Studio Marketplace [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).

You can also download the extensions directly using Visual Studio from **Extensions > Manage Extensions...** menu.
