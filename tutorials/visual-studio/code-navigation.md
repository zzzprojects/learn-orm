# Code Navigation

Visual Studio provides numerous ways to navigate code in the editor. 

## Navigate Backward and Forward

The toolbar contains the Backward and Forward navigation buttons to move the insertion point to previous locations, or to return to a more recent location from a previous location.

These buttons retain the last 20 locations of the insertion point. These commands are also available on the **View** menu, under Navigate Backward and Navigate Forward.

You can use the navigation bar which contains the drop-down boxes at the top of the code window to navigate to code in a codebase.

 - You can choose a type or member to go directly to it. 
 - The navigation bar appears when you edit code in a Visual Basic, C#, or C++ codebase. 
 - In a partial class, members defined outside the current code file may be disabled.

## Find all references

You can use the **Find All References** command to find where particular code elements are referenced throughout your codebase. You can use this command by right-clicking on the element and select the **Find All References** menu option
