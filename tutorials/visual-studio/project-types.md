# Project Types

Visual Studio includes several project types for languages such as Visual C# and Visual Basic. Visual Studio also lets you create your own project types.

You can create various types of projects using Visual Studio predefined templates depending on your requirements. When you first open Visual Studio, the start window appears, and from there, you can choose **Create a new project**.

On the **Create a new project** page, a list of your recently selected templates appears on the left. If you're not selecting from the recently used templates, you can filter all available project templates by Language, Platform, and Project type.

Let's say we want to create a project using C# language, so choose **C#** language and you will see that now all the project templates available for C# are only shown.

## Platforms

Visual Studio provides various platforms options and the list is available in the **All platforms** dropdown list, such as Android, Azure, iOS, Linux, Windows, etc.

Select the **Windows** as a platform and now you will see only project types that can be developed using C# language and can run on the Windows platform only.

## Project Types

In the **All project types**, you can see different types, such as Cloud, Desktop, Console, Games, Mobile, Web, etc.

You can also enter search text into the search box to further filter the templates, for example, let's type console in the search box.
